            This is my first entry in my "notes" section of my blog. These notes
            will just be any personal things I decide to write about during my
            journey. These notes will probably not have a lot of tech stuff in
            them, so if you're looking for that - go to my tech-blogs
            section.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            I plan on mainly just talking about whatever I feel like in these.
            To start, I wanted to say just how fun it was creating this blog
            website. It's one of the simplest websites I've made but something
            about it really spoke to me. It felt a lot more personal than a lot
            of the things I have built before.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe that's because it was built&nbsp;<em>for&nbsp;</em>me and not
            just&nbsp;<em>by&nbsp;</em>me. If that makes sense.
