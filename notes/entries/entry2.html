                <p style="text-align: left;">I have a class this semester called "Computer Forensics and Investigations." This class is taught by a current Cybersecurity FBI Special Agent, and it is awesome.&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">For a while, I've wondered exactly where I'll end up in the career field. I've honestly never been&nbsp;<em>that&nbsp;</em>worried that I wouldn't find a job. I'm getting a bacherlor's degree in Cybersecurity, have a few certs and going to get more, and have a plethora of projects under my belt - but even still, something about the future is terrifying. I don't think I am alone in that.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">When doing some research on the FBI, specifically their Cyber divisions, it really hit me that this is something I could do. And love it.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">I see all the Reddit posts talking about how long the hours are, and how government jobs have a lot of crap that goes into it that makes it unbearable..I see all that.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">But I believe a lot of that can be said about many jobs. Especially in tech.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Something about it really piques my interest and I can almost guarantee that's where I will go for a career when I get the chance. I think I have to have a couple years of experience in my field first, though.&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">Regardless, that's where I'm at. Maybe my mind will change?</p>
