              <p>Recently, I have started to get back to making YouTube videos! I honestly never thought I would start doing that again.</p>
              <p>It&apos;s just been the occasional nostalgic gaming video with some commentary during it, yapping about whatever it is that I see fit.</p>
              <p>I honestly didn&apos;t think anybody would see it, and I was okay with that. It was just the creative process and editing and expressing myself that I enjoyed!</p>
              <p>Regardless, it <strong>did</strong> get views.</p>
              <p>The first video got over 1k views and a lot of engagement and the second got over 500 views.</p>
              <p>I guess I will continue making them for fun, but I don&apos;t expect to get anywhere with it. Maybe it is just practice for when I make a channel for Cybersecurity and Computer Science! So I will be comfortable editing again.</p>
              <p>Whatever the case is, it has been fun doing it again. I&apos;m sure I will continue.</p>
              <p>School started back and it has been <strong>rough</strong>.</p>
              <p>Not really just that the classes are hard, it is more like senioritis..if you know what that is.</p>
              <p>Just ready to be done.</p>
              <p>Let&apos;s hope it is all worth it!</p>
              <p>See ya next time.</p>
